      <h4>Empty Query</h4>
      <p>
        db.collection_name.find({}) :: This is the Empty query and it will
        result all the result available is the json file.
      </p>
      <h4>Equality Query:</h4>
      <p>
        db.collection_name.find({query}) :: Here if we want to find some data
        equal to some value then we use equality query

        <br />
        Match by fieldName and its exact value
        {fieldName:value1,fieldNAme2:value2,...}
        <br />
        This , comma between key-value pair means AND
      </p>

      <h1>{}</h1>
      <h3>This is where we query data {}</h3>
      <p>
        we can query data and provide additional condition all to be done within
        {}
      </p>
      <h2>Introduction to operators</h2>
      <h3>Comparison operators</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>$eq</li>
        <li>$gt</li>
        <li>$lt</li>
        <li>$ne</li>
        <li>$gte</li>
        <li>$lte</li>
      </ul>
      Example:
      <br />
      <pre>
      {index:{"$eq":4}}
      {index:{"$gt":4}}
      {index:{"$lt":4}}
      {index:{"$lte":4}}
      {index:{"$gte":4}}

      chaining multiple operator condition with and.
      {index:{"$gte":4,"lte":20}}
      </pre>

      <h4>$in and $nin operators</h4>
      <p>
        These are in and not in operators, basically here we have to provide
        values that are to be included or not included in the result in an array
      </p>
      <pre>
        {index:{"$in":[5,6,7]}}
        {index:{"$nin":[1,2,3]}}
      </pre>
      <h4>$and operator</h4>
      <p>
        Logically combines multiple conditions resulting documents must match
        all conditions
      </p>

      <pre>
        {$and:[{condition1},{condition2},{condition3},{condition4}]
      </pre>

      <h4>So what the difference between the , and _ and this $and?</h4>
      <h4>Answer: Implicit and Explicit and</h4>
      <h4>
        Which one to use: Explicit and when querying the field with same name,
        and Implicit and when querying the field with different name
      </h4>
      <p>
        basically in implicit and , the first condition will get overwritten by
        end
      </p>
      <p>
        Example : db.collection_name.find({index:{"$ne":3},index:{"$gte":3}})
        <br />
        so we have given this condition and the value will get results with 3
        also included.
      </p>

      <h4>$or Operator</h4>
      <p>
        This operator also combines multiple condition but query will look for
        results maching any of those conditions
      </p>
      <pre>
        {$or:[{condition1},{condition2},{condition3},{condition4}]

        note:if we want to us or operator in fields with same name, its better to use $in operator
      </pre>

      <h3>Embedded documents: documents within document</h3>
      <p>Nested Document: all you need to do is use . notation</p>
      <p>Just like how we access value in objects</p>
