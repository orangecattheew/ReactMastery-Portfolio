// ES6
// It was the last major update of Javascript.
// Standard of the Javascript

// var let and const
// define,update,redifine
// const cannot mutate primitive type

// same old concept :
// var is old we can use it any where:it has a global scope and can be redefined , updated .

// whereas let and const are following block scope concept.
// let cannot be redefined but it can be updated
// const means constant value : for primitive datatypes it can not be updated.:For all datatypes it cannot be redefined.

// recommendation is to use let and const as we wont encounter any surprises and its better to write clean and organized code
